# Magic the gathering collection API
This is meant to be a simple wrapper around a Postgres14 database that provides an API endpoint to add a card to the database.
At some point in time there should exist a scanning app that finds out a unique identifier for a card to populate the database quicker.
Finally, a robot should automatically move cards one after the other in front of a camera to completely automate digitizing a collection.

## Used technology and setup
As mentioned, a PostgresDB Version 14 is needed.
